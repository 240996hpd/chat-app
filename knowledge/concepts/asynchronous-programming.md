# Asynchronous Programming

## What is it?
A programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to run independently, so the program can continue running while waiting for operations like network requests.

## How is it used in this project?
Event handling and network communication (like sending/receiving messages) are asynchronous, allowing the app to remain responsive and efficient.
