# Separation of Concerns

## What is it?
A design principle for organizing code so that different parts of a program handle distinct responsibilities.

## How is it used in this project?
HTML handles structure, CSS handles styling, JavaScript handles interactivity, and Node.js/Express handles backend logic, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
