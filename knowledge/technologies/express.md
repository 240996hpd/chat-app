# Express

## What is Express?
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, such as routing, middleware support, and serving static files.

## How is Express used in this project?
Express is used to create the web server in `server.js`. It serves the static files from the `public/` directory and sets up the HTTP server that Socket.io attaches to for real-time communication.
