# JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables interactive web pages and dynamic user interfaces. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript can run in browsers (client-side) and on servers (using Node.js).

## How is JavaScript used in this project?
- **Client-side:**  
  In `public/script.js`, JavaScript handles user interactions, sends and receives messages via Socket.io, updates the DOM in real time, and manages the chat UI.
- **Server-side:**  
  In `server.js`, JavaScript is used to write all backend logic, including handling HTTP requests, managing users, and broadcasting messages using Node.js and Socket.io.
