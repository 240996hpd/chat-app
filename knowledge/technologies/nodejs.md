# Node.js

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on servers. Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
